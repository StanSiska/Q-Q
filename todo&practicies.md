# Our best practicies

#Fail fast principle 
  - in code as well as in decision making


#Owin standards
  instead of returning null throw an exception or return server Error 500

#Why I choose VS code
There are dozens .Node dev IDE but three of them are preferred by community: 

- Jetbrains WebStorm: from my experience - the best. Unfortunately it is not free

- VS Code 
1.  Full-featured developer IDE immidiatelly after installing.
2.  Unified accross team 
3.  Strong support by  MS
4.  Up to five members team it is for free
5.  Debbuging Node apps
6.  Refactoring
7.  It has NOTHING TO DO with MS visual studio 2010,2012,2013,2015.
    
* If we are strongly dissatisfied, we can switch *     

- Sublime 
1. Widely used IDE, unfortunately you need adjust everything (install extensions for refactoring, colors,
 npm, adjust any shortcut etc.. ). 
2. I don't know whether it knows debugging.
3. The danger lies at fact that any developer will have a significantly different configuration and use 
   significantly different extensions. 
4. Under some circumstances you need purchase license
